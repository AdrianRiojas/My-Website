  <p> Pluto had been discovered on February 18th of 1930 and was both classified as a planet and named within the same year. Being discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh an American astronomer in the Lowell Observatory. That same year a year English girl gave this planet it's name, Pluto. Since its initial planetary discovery pluto has sincebeen reclassified as a dwarf planet. Barely making a third of its orbit, Pluto was so rudely interupted in 2006 to be declassified as a planet due to their size. Pluto is only about half the size of the United States of America. And because Pluto is so far away, orbits at an angle, and is so tiny it was re assigned the title of dwarf planet.</p>
